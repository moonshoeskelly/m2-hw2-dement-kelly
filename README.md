# Issues
I could not figure out how to center the single image layout for small size and below. I tried several of the options on Bootstrap's grid page, but could not get it to center properly. I worked around it by adding a media query in the CSS file. 

# Outside Resources
I used the [Bootstrap Website](https://getbootstrap.com/) to find the different code I would need for the grid, components, and utilities.
